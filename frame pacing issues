First you need to set the refresh rate to 59hz

For GameCube games that completely eliminates the bad framerate pacing

For Wii games that creates an issue with the audio where it starts to crackle very badly, but fortunately there is a fix for that. In the game.ini edition add this option
[Video_Hacks] and under that VISkip = True

This will eliminate any audio issues when setting the refresh rate to 59hz on Wii games.

DO NOT USE VI SKIP ON GAMECUBE GAMES SINCE THAT WILL MESS UP THE GAMES FRAMERATE.
